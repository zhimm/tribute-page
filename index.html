            <h2 id="title">Timeline of BB King's life: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1925</b> - Born in Berclair, Mississippi </li>
                <li><b>1931-33</b> - Parents separate and King’s mother moves with Riley to hilly part of Mississippi
                    east of the Delta</li>
                <li><b>1935</b> - King leaves with his grandmother after his mother. His church is Church of God In
                    Christ (a.k.a. “Sanctified Church”), led by Reverend Archie Fair, who plays guitar in the services.
                    Archie’s wife and King’s aunt are sisters, and when they visit, Riley is allowed to play the
                    Reverend’s guitar. It is love at first touch.</li>
                <li><b>1940</b> - After his grandmother Elnora Farr dies on January 10, Albert King (King's father)
                    arrives and takes his son to live in Lexington, Mississippi (pop. 3,000 approx.).</li>
                <li><b>1948</b> - King moves to West Memphis, AR, across the Mississippi River from Memphis and goes
                    straight to radio KWEM and plays a song live on Sonny Boy Williamson’s daily program. This leads to
                    multiple gigs.</li>
                <li><b>1950</b> - Regional stardom on radio and in area joints around Tennessee, Arkansas, and
                    Mississippi brings King to the attention of a small record label; he cuts four sides for Bullett
                    Records. Radio spot expands, Peptikon Boy becomes “Blues Boy,” then plain “B.B.” King. Survives a
                    near fatal bout of hepatitis. He rushes back into a fiery, burning dance hall to save his guitar,
                    thereafter named “Lucille” as a reminder to avoid foolish risks.</li>
                <li><b>1952</b> - B.B. signs with Universal Attractions booking agency and goes on tour </li>
                <li><b>1955</b> - Forms first big “B.B. King Band,” buys first bus, “Big Red.” King and his band
                    reportedly play 340 one-night engagements.</li>
                <li><b>1963</b> - Records “How Blue Can You Get?” written by jazz critic Leonard Feather. The song
                    becomes one of B.B.’s most recognizable signature songs.</li>
                <li><b>1969</b> - BluesWay records two B.B. King albums, Live and Well, and Completely Well, both
                    produced by Bill Szymczyk. The second includes a track recorded with strings, an adaptation of Roy
                    Hawkins, “The Thrill Is Gone.” It reaches #3 on the R&B charts and #15 on the Pop charts.</li>
                <li><b>1970</b> - “The Thrill Is Gone,” earns B.B. his first Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal
                    Performance.</li>
                <li><b>1996</b> - B.B. King’s autobiography, Blues All Around Me (written with David Ritz for Avon
                    Books), is published.</li>
